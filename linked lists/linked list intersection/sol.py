# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
# You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
# Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
